It serves as an indicator of failed read or write operations under specific conditions.  \n\nThe signal is triggered when a read or write operation is attempted without the **INT_RX** or **TX** signals being in a **HIGH** state. This means that **PSLVERR** acts as a safeguard, ensuring that transactions on the APB bus are only executed when the necessary control signals (**INT_RX** or **TX**) are properly asserted.  \n\nWhile one description specifies that **PSLVERR** indicates a failed read operation, another clarifies that it applies to both read and write operations. The consistent theme across all descriptions is that **PSLVERR** functions as an error flag when bus transactions violate expected conditions (i.e., when **INT_RX** or **TX** are not **HIGH**).  \n\nIn summary, **PSLVERR** is an APB bus error signal that activates when an invalid read or write operation occurs due to the absence of required control signals (**INT_RX** or **TX** in a **HIGH** state).

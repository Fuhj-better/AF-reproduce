This means that **PSLVERR** acts as a safeguard, ensuring that transactions on the APB bus are only executed when the necessary control signals (**INT_RX** or **TX**) are properly asserted.  \n\nWhile one description specifies that **PSLVERR** indicates a failed read operation, another clarifies that it applies to both read and write operations.

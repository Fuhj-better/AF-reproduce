The figure captures a scenario where the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) attempts to read data but encounters a **PSLVERR (Peripheral Slave Error)**, indicating a failure in the transaction. This error is depicted to highlight potential issues in APB Protocol read operations, serving as an example of how such failures manifest in the system. The descriptions consistently emphasize that **FIGURE 4** focuses on the **read PSLVERR fail**, providing a clear visual representation of this specific error condition.  \n\nIn summary, **FIGURE 4** serves as a reference for understanding **APB Protocol read errors**, particularly those involving **PSLVERR**, and aids in diagnosing or analyzing similar failures in APB-based systems.

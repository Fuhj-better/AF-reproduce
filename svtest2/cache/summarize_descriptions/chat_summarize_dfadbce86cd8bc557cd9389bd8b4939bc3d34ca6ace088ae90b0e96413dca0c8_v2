Specifically, **PWDATA Input 32** is utilized for this purpose, indicating that it handles 32-bit data transfers when writing to the FIFO TX. Both descriptions confirm that PWDATA functions as the primary interface for transmitting data into the TX FIFO, ensuring coherent and efficient data flow. The term \"data port\" emphasizes its role in facilitating communication between the data source and the FIFO buffer.  \n\nIn summary, PWDATA acts as a 32-bit write interface for the TX FIFO, enabling data transmission through a structured and sequential buffering mechanism.

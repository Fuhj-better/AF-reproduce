It serves as an indicator of failed read or write operations under specific conditions.  \n\nThe signal is triggered when a read or write operation is attempted without the **INT_RX** or **TX** signals being in a **HIGH** state. This means that **PSLVERR** acts as a safeguard, ensuring that transactions on the APB bus are only executed when the necessary control signals (**INT_RX** or **TX**) are properly asserted.  \n\nWhile one description specifies that **PSLVERR** indicates a failed read operation, another clarifies that it applies to both read and write operations. The consistent theme across all descriptions is that **PSLVERR** functions as an error flag when bus transactions violate expected conditions (i.e., when **INT_RX** or **TX** are not **HIGH**).  \n\nIn summary, **PSLVERR** is an APB bus error signal that activates when an invalid read or write operation occurs due to the absence of required control signals (**INT_RX** or **TX** in a **HIGH** state). It ensures proper bus protocol adherence by flagging unauthorized or improperly timed transactions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749791882, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 255, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 210}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

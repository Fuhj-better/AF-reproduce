Conversely, **OPEN SOURCE RTL** is described as being a component or part of the **GLADCI** module, suggesting a bidirectional relationship where the framework is both utilized by and integrated into **GLADCI**. This implies that **GLADCI** leverages **OPEN SOURCE RTL** for its design and functionality, while **OPEN SOURCE RTL** may also play a role within the broader architecture of **GLADCI**. Together, they represent a collaborative or dependent relationship in hardware development, with **OPEN SOURCE RTL** providing the underlying infrastructure and **GLADCI** building upon or incorporating it.  \n\nThe summary resolves the apparent contradiction by interpreting the descriptions as complementary: **OPEN SOURCE RTL** is both a tool used to develop **GLADCI** and a constituent part of its structure.
